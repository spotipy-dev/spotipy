### Added

- Added `market` parameter to `album` and `albums` to address ([#753](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/issues/753)
- Added `show_featured_artists.py` to `/examples`.
- Expanded contribution and license sections of the documentation.

## [2.20.0] - 2022-06-18

### Added

- Added `RedisCacheHandler`, a cache handler that stores the token info in Redis.
- Changed URI handling in `client.Spotify._get_id()` to remove queries if provided by error.
- Added a new parameter to `RedisCacheHandler` to allow custom keys (instead of the default `token_info` key)

- If a network request returns an error status code but the response body cannot be decoded into JSON, then fall back on decoding the body into a string.
- Added `DjangoSessionCacheHandler`, a cache handler that stores the token in the session framework provided by Django. Web apps using spotipy with Django can directly use this for cache handling.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in `CacheFileHandler.__init__`: The documentation says that the username will be retrieved from the environment, but it wasn't.
- Fixed a bug in the initializers for the auth managers that produced a spurious warning message if you provide a cache handler, and you set a value for the "SPOTIPY_CLIENT_USERNAME" environment variable.

## [2.18.0] - 2021-04-13

### Added

- Enabled using both short and long IDs for playlist_change_details

  - `Spotify.available_markets`

### Changed

- Add support for a list of scopes rather than just a comma separated string of scopes

### Fixed

- Fixed the bugs in `SpotifyOAuth.refresh_access_token` and `SpotifyPKCE.refresh_access_token` which raised the incorrect exception upon receiving an error response from the server. This addresses #645.
- Fixed a bug in `RequestHandler.do_GET` in which the non-existent `state` attribute of `SpotifyOauthError` is accessed. This bug occurs when the user clicks "cancel" in the permissions dialog that opens in the browser.
- Cleaned up the documentation for `SpotifyClientCredentials.__init__`, `SpotifyOAuth.__init__`, and `SpotifyPKCE.__init__`.

## [2.17.1] - 2021-02-28

### Fixed

- `allowed_methods` requires urllib3>=1.26.0

## [2.17.0] - 2021-02-28

### Changed

- moved os.remove(session_cache_path()) inside try block to avoid TypeError on app.py example file
- A warning will no longer be emitted when the cache file does not exist at the specified path
- The docs for the `auth` parameter of `Spotify.init` use the term "access token" instead of "authorization token"

- Deprecate specifying `cache_path` or `username` directly to `SpotifyOAuth`, `SpotifyPKCE`, and `SpotifyImplicitGrant` constructors, instead directing users to use the `CacheFileHandler` cache handler
- Removed requirement for examples/app.py to specify port multiple times (only SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI needs to contain the port)

### Added

- Added log messages for when the access and refresh tokens are retrieved and when they are refreshed
- Support `market` optional parameter in `track`
- Added CacheHandler abstraction to allow users to cache tokens in any way they see fit

### Fixed

- SpotifyException now thrown when a request fails & has no response ([#571](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/issues/571), [#581](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/issues/581))
- Added scope, `playlist-read-private`, to examples that access user playlists using the spotipy api: current_user_playlists() ([#591](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/issues/591))
- Enable retries for POST, DELETE, PUT ([#577](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/issues/577))

### Added

- `SpotifyPKCE.parse_auth_response_url`, mirroring that method in
  `SpotifyOAuth`

### Changed

### Fixed

- Using `SpotifyPKCE.get_authorization_url` will now generate a code
  challenge if needed

## [2.14.0] - 2020-08-29

### Added

- (experimental) Support to search multiple/all markets at once.
- Support to test whether the current user is following certain
  users or artists
- Proper replacements for all deprecated playlist endpoints
  (See https://developer.spotify.com/community/news/2018/06/12/changes-to-playlist-uris/ and below)

- `user_playlist_replace_tracks` in favor of `playlist_replace_items`
- `user_playlist_reorder_tracks` in favor of `playlist_reorder_items`
- `user_playlist_remove_all_occurrences_of_tracks` in favor of
  `playlist_remove_all_occurrences_of_items`
- `user_playlist_remove_specific_occurrences_of_tracks` in favor of

### Fixed

- fixed issue where episode URIs were being converted to track URIs in playlist calls

## [2.13.0] - 2020-06-25

### Added

- Added `SpotifyImplicitGrant` as an auth manager option. It provides
  user authentication without a client secret but sacrifices the ability
  to refresh the token without user input. (However, read the class
  docstring for security advisory.)
- Added built-in verification of the `state` query parameter
- Added two new attributes: error and error_description to `SpotifyOauthError` exception class to show
  authorization/authentication web api errors details.
- Added `SpotifyStateError` subclass of `SpotifyOauthError`
- Allow extending `SpotifyClientCredentials` and `SpotifyOAuth`
- Added the market parameter to `album_tracks`

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `util.prompt_for_user_token` in favor of `spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth())`

## [2.11.2] - 2020-04-19

### Changed

- Updated the documentation to give more details on the authorization process and reflect
  2020 Spotify Application jargon and practices.

- The local webserver is only started for localhost redirect_uri which specify a port,
  i.e. it is started for `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, not for `http://localhost`.

### Fixed

- Issue where using `http://localhost` as redirect_uri would cause the authorization process to hang.

## [2.11.1] - 2020-04-11

### Fixed

- Fixed miscellaneous issues with parsing of callback URL

## [2.11.0] - 2020-04-11

  - status_forcelist
  - retries
  - status_retries
  - backoff_factor
- Spin up a local webserver to autofill authentication URL
- Use session in SpotifyAuthBase
- Logging used instead of print statements

### Fixed

- Close session when Spotipy object is unloaded
- Propagate refresh token error

## [2.10.0] - 2020-03-18

### Added

- Support for `add_to_queue`

- CI for unit tests
- Automatic `token` refresh
- `auth_manager` and `oauth_manager` optional parameters added to `Spotify`'s init.
- Optional `username` parameter to be passed to `SpotifyOAuth`, to infer a `cache_path` automatically
- Optional `as_dict` parameter to control `SpotifyOAuth`'s `get_access_token` output type. However, this is going to be deprecated in the future, and the method will always return a token string
- Optional `show_dialog` parameter to be passed to `SpotifyOAuth`

### Changed

- Both `SpotifyClientCredentials` and `SpotifyOAuth` inherit from a common `SpotifyAuthBase` which handles common parameters and logics.

## [2.7.1] - 2020-01-20
