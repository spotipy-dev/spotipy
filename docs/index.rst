Welcome to Spotipy!
===================================

*Spotipy* is a lightweight Python library for the `Spotify Web API
<https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/>`_. With *Spotipy*
you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.

Features
========

*Spotipy* supports all of the features of the Spotify Web API including access
to all end points, and support for user authorization. For details on the
capabilities you are encouraged to review the `Spotify Web
API <https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/>`_ documentation.

Installation
============

Install or upgrade *Spotipy* with::

    pip install spotipy --upgrade

You can also obtain the source code from the `Spotipy GitHub repository <https://github.com/plamere/spotipy>`_.


Getting Started
===============

All methods require user authorization. You will need to register your app at 
`My Dashboard <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications>`_ 
to get the credentials necessary to make authorized calls
(a *client id* and *client secret*).



*Spotipy* supports two authorization flows:

  - **Authorization Code flow** This method is suitable for long-running applications
    which the user logs into once. It provides an access token that can be refreshed.

    .. note:: Requires you to add a redirect URI to your application at 
              `My Dashboard <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications>`_.
              See `Redirect URI`_ for more details.

  - **Client Credentials flow**  This method makes it possible
    to authenticate your requests to the Spotify Web API and to obtain
    a higher rate limit than you would with the Authorization Code flow.


For guidance on setting your app credentials watch this `video tutorial <https://youtu.be/kaBVN8uP358>`_ or follow the
`Spotipy Tutorial for Beginners <https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/blob/2.22.1/TUTORIAL.md>`_.

For a longer tutorial with examples included, refer to this `video playlist <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmt5SdvTqUI&list=PLqgOPibB_QnzzcaOFYmY2cQjs35y0is9N&index=1>`_. 


Authorization Code Flow
=======================

This flow is suitable for long-running applications in which the user grants
permission only once. It provides an access token that can be refreshed.
Since the token exchange involves sending your secret key, perform this on a
secure location, like a backend service, and not from a client such as a
browser or from a mobile app.

Quick start
-----------

To support the **Client Authorization Code Flow** *Spotipy* provides a
class SpotifyOAuth that can be used to authenticate requests like so::

    import spotipy
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth

    scope = "user-library-read"

    sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(scope=scope))

    results = sp.current_user_saved_tracks()
    for idx, item in enumerate(results['items']):
        track = item['track']
        print(idx, track['artists'][0]['name'], " â€“ ", track['name'])

or if you are reluctant to immortalize your app credentials in your source code,
you can set environment variables like so (use ``$env:"credentials"`` instead of ``export``
on Windows)::

    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'
    export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='your-app-redirect-url'


Scopes
------

See `Using
Scopes <https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes/>`_ for information
about scopes.

Redirect URI
------------

The **Authorization Code Flow** needs you to add a **redirect URI**
to your application at 
`My Dashboard <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications>`_
(navigate to your application and then *[Edit Settings]*).

The ``redirect_uri`` argument or ``SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI`` environment variable
must match the redirect URI added to your application in your Dashboard.
The redirect URI can be any valid URI (it does not need to be accessible)
such as ``http://example.com`` or ``http://127.0.0.1:9090``.

    .. note:: If you choose an `http`-scheme URL, and it's for
     `127.0.0.1`, **AND** it specifies a port, then spotipy will instantiate
      a server on the indicated response to receive the access token from the
      response at the end of the oauth flow [see the code](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/blob/master/spotipy/oauth2.py#L483-L490).


Client Credentials Flow
=======================

The Client Credentials flow is used in server-to-server authentication. Only
endpoints that do not access user information can be accessed. The advantage here
in comparison with requests to the Web API made without an access token,
is that a higher rate limit is applied.

As opposed to the Authorization Code Flow, you will not need to set ``SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI``,
which means you will never be redirected to the sign in page in your browser::

    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'

To support the **Client Credentials Flow** *Spotipy* provides a
class SpotifyClientCredentials that can be used to authenticate requests like so::


    import spotipy
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

    auth_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials()
    sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=auth_manager)

    playlists = sp.user_playlists('spotify')
    while playlists:
        for i, playlist in enumerate(playlists['items']):
            print(f"{i + 1 + playlists['offset']:4d} {playlist['uri']} {playlist['name']}")
        if playlists['next']:
            playlists = sp.next(playlists)
        else:
            playlists = None


IDs URIs and URLs
=================

*Spotipy* supports a number of different ID types:

  - **Spotify URI** - The resource identifier that you can enter, for example, in
    the Spotify Desktop client's search box to locate an artist, album, or
    track. Example: ``spotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6``
  - **Spotify URL** - An HTML link that opens a track, album, app, playlist or other
    Spotify resource in a Spotify client. Example:
    ``http://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6``
  - **Spotify ID** - A base-62 number that you can find at the end of the Spotify
    URI (see above) for an artist, track, album, etc. Example:
    ``6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6``

In general, any *Spotipy* method that needs an artist, album, track or playlist ID
will accept ids in any of the above form


Customized token caching
========================

Tokens are refreshed automatically and stored by default in the project main folder.
As this might not suit everyone's needs, spotipy provides a way to create customized
cache handlers.

https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/blob/master/spotipy/cache_handler.py

The custom cache handler would need to be a class that inherits from the base
cache handler ``CacheHandler``. The default cache handler ``CacheFileHandler`` is a good example.
An instance of that new class can then be passed as a parameter when
creating ``SpotifyOAuth``, ``SpotifyPKCE`` or ``SpotifyImplicitGrant``.
The following handlers are available and defined in the URL above.

  - ``CacheFileHandler``
  - ``MemoryCacheHandler``
  - ``DjangoSessionCacheHandler``
  - ``FlaskSessionCacheHandler``
  - ``RedisCacheHandler``
  - ``MemcacheCacheHandler``: install with dependency using ``pip install "spotipy[pymemcache]"``

Feel free to contribute new cache handlers to the repo.


Examples
=======================
 
Here is an example of using *Spotipy* to list the
names of all the albums released by the artist 'Birdy'::

    import spotipy
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

    birdy_uri = 'spotify:artist:2WX2uTcsvV5OnS0inACecP'
    spotify = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials())

    results = spotify.artist_albums(birdy_uri, album_type='album')
    albums = results['items']
    while results['next']:
        results = spotify.next(results)
        albums.extend(results['items'])

    for album in albums:
        print(album['name'])

Here's another example showing how to get 30 second samples and cover art
for the top 10 tracks for Led Zeppelin::

    import spotipy
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

    lz_uri = 'spotify:artist:36QJpDe2go2KgaRleHCDTp'

    spotify = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials())
    results = spotify.artist_top_tracks(lz_uri)

    for track in results['tracks'][:10]:
        print('track    : ' + track['name'])
        print('audio    : ' + track['preview_url'])
        print('cover art: ' + track['album']['images'][0]['url'])
        print()

Finally, here's an example that will get the URL for an artist image given the
artist's name::

    import spotipy
    import sys
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

    spotify = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials())

    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        name = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])
    else:
        name = 'Radiohead'

    results = spotify.search(q='artist:' + name, type='artist')
    items = results['artists']['items']
    if len(items) > 0:
        artist = items[0]
        print(artist['name'], artist['images'][0]['url'])

There are many more examples of how to use *Spotipy* in the `spotipy-examples
repository <https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy-examples>`_ on GitHub.
